<div id="short-story">
    <p>Hi There! Running a business could be really costly which might not help you earn but instead spend money. I started helping businesses when I worked as an assistant on an e-commerce site. I started to notice that there are a lot of tools, resources, tasks, and other processes that are not actually that necessary but causing more expenses. 

        <br><br>This caused me to formulate a method that I already applied to businesses that did improve their cost savings.
        
        <br><br>My name is Romel Cari√±o and my expertise in process improvement helped those businesses to save costs and earned more. </p>
        <p class="second-message">Just like them, they were having problems with their status but after discovering my method, they did improve. I would like to also help you with your business.<br><br>To learn more about the program, please click the button below.</p>

<div id="short-intro">
    <h1>Why is process improvement necessary?</h1>
    <p>
        A former Boxer named Oscar De La Hoya once said "There is always space for improvement, no matter how long you've been in the business." Improvement has always been the pursuit of many business in terms earning money. Without improvement, there can be no progress.

Many business struggles with managing a lot of aspects including finance, process and policies. Many of them ask what should be done first or what could be the problem when they dont earn much.

<br><br>As a virtual assistant, my main goal is to help your company to check for improvement so that you can earn more</p>

<h1>A Special Case</h1>
<p>
   
Danny is one of my clients who had struggles with his sales. When I first worked with him, he was earning an average about $580,000 per month. However, after I worked with him, he now earns at least an average of $830,000 a month. That's about 60% increase of sales!
</p>

<h1>A Caution and a Guarantee</h1>
<p>
    
I won't promise that when you apply my process that you will also achieve the same result however if you are not happy with the service, we will refund the money for the payment for the service.<br><br>To learn more about the program, please click on the "Learn More" button below.
