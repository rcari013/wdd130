        <p>Mangaldan owns the distinction as the third town in Pangasinan to be founded by the Dominican missionaries. As early as 1591, Mangaldan already existed as a Spanish encomienda. Its foundation as a town is attributed to Blessed Juan Martinez de Santo Domingo, a former missionary of Pangasinan who died a martyr's death in Japan on 19 March 1618. Mangaldan started as a "visita" of Calasiao and it remained as such until the Dominicans created it as an independent vicariate under the patronage of St. Thomas Aquinas on 2 June 1600. It is said that of all the people of Pangasinan, the Mangaldanian were the most difficult to convert. <br><br>

            
            Mangaldan celebrates its annual Pindang Festival along with its town fiesta during first week of March. The popular carabeef tapa (Filipino-style dried meat), locally known as Pindang is the One Town One Product (OTOP) of this municipality. The municipality is also the home of the original makers of the famous delicacy – the Romana Peanut Brittle. It also provides one of the delicious delicacies of Pangasinan which is called "tupig". The town is also being passed when citizens go to the capital of the Philippines which is Manila City. The town bagged the grand slam award when its inland body of water, the Angalacan River, was adjudged as the cleanest river in the entire province for the third time which was awarded in 2012. One of the major sources of revenues here are the thriving market place and the laboratories of renowned pharmaceutical companies that buttressed the coffer of this town. The municipal government operates its slaughterhouse with a rated "double A" by the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) that guarantees the butchered meat as safe and clean.</p>
