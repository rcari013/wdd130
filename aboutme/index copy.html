        <p>I am headed down to being a programmer and a project manager in 
the future I guess.</p>

<p>I love studying and reading.</p>

<p>I am married and I don't have a child yet.</p>

<p>I am currently employed however I am taking courses so that I can be prepared for the future.</p>

<p>What I love about the BYU-Idaho is the opportunity it gives us to study at our own pace and participate with other people to learn. I am taking Bachelor of Science in Applied Technology but I am planning to probably switch to professional studies.</p>

<p>I am taking website developing  because I would like to learn for a better paying job.</p>

<p>I've been a member of the church for 12 years now. The recent quote that I love is what Elder D. Todd Christofferson said that "We ought not to think of Godâ€™s plan as a cosmic vending machine where we (1) select a desired blessing, (2) insert the required sum of good works, and (3) the order is promptly delivered."</p>
